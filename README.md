# Jagged Alliance 3 mod(s)

## Dream Team

This is a compilation of changes made for my second playthrough.  
It contains numerous changes to the base game like:

- Different and additional starting perks (talents and traits) for all mercs
- Changed starting gear
- Generalized some personal items so everybody can use them
- Generalized some perks, changed perks to be used on other mercs (e.g. ```Elbow Grease``` for ```Livewire```)
- IMP can choose more perks
- Also customized some language lines to accomodate for the changes
